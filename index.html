       <p>Sally Ride Diversity Piece</p>

<p>Sally Ride represents diversity because she is an accomplished astronaut in a time that there were very few women astronauts. She was also LGBTQ, which was practically unheard of for a historical figure. She was the first American woman in space and is a pioneer for women's space aviation. She exemplifies diversity in her field in a time where very few women held high scientific roles in society.</p>
       <p>PART A (Austin DuFrene)</p>
       <p>PART B (Christian Herinckx)</p>
       <p>PART C (Michael Burke)</p>
<p>A. Sally Ride was the first American woman in space and the third woman in space. She was an astronaut, physicist, and engineer who graduated from Stanford University and worked for NASA. Ride spent over 343 hours in space and she was also LGBTQ. She was admitted to the California Hall of Fame and was granted the greatest honor given by the Space Foundation, a space lifetime achievement award.
Sally Ride is a noteworthy example of diversity in science, however, her discoveries aren’t taught, mostly due to the highly complex nature of astrophysics. Not only was she a pioneer for women’s space aviation, but she also set an example for women in science. Before her first spaceflight, she was bombarded by questions regarding her sexuality and how that would affect her. Not all of these questions were particularly insightful, some were downright mocking. However, her advances in science, such as assistance in uncovering data on the Challenger and Columbia disasters were vital. She also created the Sally Ride Science company, that focused on getting elementary and middle aged girls invested in science, something that was applicable to general education.
Sally Ride’s life demonstrates that diversity is present in science, but that we need more of it. Her accomplishments at NASA and teaching in a classroom at Stanford both furthered the education of many and widened the research of physics and engineering. She was able to assist with astrophysics in new ways and discover problems that some men would never think of, such as where she provided information on the Challenger disaster and O-rings. She changed the idea of what a scientist was and is, at least to me, as astronauts, for the most part, were largely test pilots.</p>
<p>B. To conduct this research on Sally Ride, we used Wikipedia. While not the most trustworthy or direct of sources, it allowed us to accurately answer the questions. Wikipedia uses a multitude of articles to sum up the information about her life, the majority of which were articles of space that included her as the first American woman in space. These sources (the ones Wikipedia derives from) are quality because they are either written by Sally Ride herself or they are official and trustworthy sources such as NASA. There was not much difficulty in researching Sally Ride because she is such an important figure in history and to the women's rights movement with the fact that she was the first American woman in space.
One academic source that talks about Sally Ride and her biographical data are NASA.gov. A popular press article about Sally Ride is the Huffington Post article titled “Sally Ride, First American Woman In Space, Revealed To Have Female Partner Of 27 Years.” This article provides a lot of information about how Sally Ride is part of the LGBTQ community and also mentions how she struggled and died due to pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>C. The diversity of human experience is a clear goal addressed in the research of Sally Ride. Since Sally Ride is such a pioneer woman in space travel, she provides diversity to the field through her contributions. Sally Ride even further paved the way for future diversity in science, by being a model and giving structure for women in the future to get into space travel. Her experience addresses the diversity of human experience goal because of the diverse female and LGBTQ perspective she brought forward.
Sally Ride's life also addresses the goal of ethics and social responsibility. Through both her eventful space travel career and the Sally Ride Science company she founded, she opened up the door for future women to enter the industry. This addresses ethics and social responsibility through her impact toward the future of the industry, where more diverse perspectives and people could be more accepted.</p>
