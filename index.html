       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Sally Ride Diversity Piece</h2>
       <p>Diversity is the use of multiple perspectives to analyze a subject. These perspectives come from how people vary: their race, gender, socioeconomic status, political status, etc. Diversity is necessary because it is important to include all people when discussing and inventing new ideas. For example, a product will be more likely to succeed if it attracts multiple diverse groups instead of just a single group of people. The effects of lack of diversity can be seen heavily in some industries such as medicine and politics.</p>
       <hr>

<p>Sally Ride represents diversity because she is an accomplished astronaut in a time that there were very few women astronauts. She was also LGBTQ, which was practically unheard of for a historical figure. She was the first American woman in space and is a pioneer for women's space aviation. She exemplifies diversity in her field in a time where very few women held high scientific roles in society.</p>
       <p>PART A (Austin DuFrene)</p>
       <p>PART B (Christian Herinckx)</p>
       <p>PART C (Michael Burke)</p>
<p>A. Sally Ride was the first American woman in space and the third woman in space. She was an astronaut, physicist, and engineer who graduated from Stanford University and worked for NASA. Ride spent over 343 hours in space and she was also LGBTQ. She was admitted to the California Hall of Fame and was granted the greatest honor given by the Space Foundation, a space lifetime achievement award.
Sally Ride is a noteworthy example of diversity in science, however, her discoveries aren’t taught, mostly due to the highly complex nature of astrophysics. Not only was she a pioneer for women’s space aviation, but she also set an example for women in science. Before her first spaceflight, she was bombarded by questions regarding her sexuality and how that would affect her. Not all of these questions were particularly insightful, some were downright mocking. However, her advances in science, such as assistance in uncovering data on the Challenger and Columbia disasters were vital. She also created the Sally Ride Science company, that focused on getting elementary and middle aged girls invested in science, something that was applicable to general education.
Sally Ride’s life demonstrates that diversity is present in science, but that we need more of it. Her accomplishments at NASA and teaching in a classroom at Stanford both furthered the education of many and widened the research of physics and engineering. She was able to assist with astrophysics in new ways and discover problems that some men would never think of, such as where she provided information on the Challenger disaster and O-rings. She changed the idea of what a scientist was and is, at least to me, as astronauts, for the most part, were largely test pilots.</p>
<p>B. To conduct this research on Sally Ride, we used Wikipedia. While not the most trustworthy or direct of sources, it allowed us to accurately answer the questions. Wikipedia uses a multitude of articles to sum up the information about her life, the majority of which were articles of space that included her as the first American woman in space. These sources (the ones Wikipedia derives from) are quality because they are either written by Sally Ride herself or they are official and trustworthy sources such as NASA. There was not much difficulty in researching Sally Ride because she is such an important figure in history and to the women's rights movement with the fact that she was the first American woman in space.
One academic source that talks about Sally Ride and her biographical data are NASA.gov. A popular press article about Sally Ride is the Huffington Post article titled “Sally Ride, First American Woman In Space, Revealed To Have Female Partner Of 27 Years.” This article provides a lot of information about how Sally Ride is part of the LGBTQ community and also mentions how she struggled and died due to pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>C. The diversity of human experience is a clear goal addressed in the research of Sally Ride. Since Sally Ride is such a pioneer woman in space travel, she provides diversity to the field through her contributions. Sally Ride even further paved the way for future diversity in science, by being a model and giving structure for women in the future to get into space travel. Her experience addresses the diversity of human experience goal because of the diverse female and LGBTQ perspective she brought forward.
Sally Ride's life also addresses the goal of ethics and social responsibility. Through both her eventful space travel career and the Sally Ride Science company she founded, she opened up the door for future women to enter the industry. This addresses ethics and social responsibility through her impact toward the future of the industry, where more diverse perspectives and people could be more accepted.</p>

       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Stem Letter</h2>
       <p style="text-align: right;">October 4th, 2018</p>
       <p>The letter to STEM teachers belongs under diversity because it addresses the lack of diversity in both the scientific field and curriculum. It also mentions certain diverse individuals who should be studied in STEM classrooms because their contributions have made a significant change to who we are today.</p>
       <p>Dear former STEM teachers,</p>
       <p>We have written this letter to discuss the use of diversity in STEM in school curriculum. Overall, the presence of women scientists needs to be more prevalent in discussions in classrooms for many reasons. Women as a population are very underrepresented in the science community despite the brilliant discoveries and work ethic they have brought to the field. Rosalind Franklin is a perfect example of how women are underrepresented and not accurately portrayed in discoveries. Using crystallography and X-ray diffraction, she was able to discover the composition of DNA as well as fully develop and support theories on DNA. After dying tragically young, her evidence was taken by a male colleague and given to a competing scientist who then claimed her findings as his own and he is to this day associated with that discovery. Rosalind Franklin absolutely needs to be discussed in science classrooms not only as a successful researcher, but also as the subject of male privilege and sexism that is still prevalent in STEAM today. Overall, there needs to be more women scientists discussed in science classrooms to develop the idea of diversity in young minds.</p>
       <p>The discussion of diversity in STEM is vital to the development of students. The demographics within the science field do not match those of the general population. This means that a lot of minorities don’t see themselves fairly represented. Without diversity in the STEM field we limit ourselves to the ideas and intelligence of only certain groups of people, this results not only in social issues but in safety issues for minorities. By talking about a more diverse range of scientists in classroom, we can change the way people think about scientists. Showing young girls and people of color that there are scientists like them will inspire a more diverse population to go into STEM. Often times, young boys who express an interest in science are encouraged and people don’t think anything of it. On the other hand, when a girl says she wants to go into a STEM field she gets warned about the difficulty of succeeding; people are then surprised if she is good at science. This ties into the reading, “The Trouble We’re In: Privilege, Power, and Difference,” by Allan G. Johnson. On page 9 he wrote, “Men can succeed without others being surprised.” This statement is especially true in STEM, it’s seen primarily as a white man’s territory. Diversity in science is essential to solving problems that impact all groups of people. By teaching a more diverse curriculum, students will gain a more open and understanding world view and we will encourage more kids to enter STEM fields.</p>
       <p>There are numerous other examples of privilege talked about in “The Trouble We’re In: Privilege, Power, and Difference” that were present in the history of scientific discoveries. People were surprised when Sally Ride succeeded in space, something that males had done for years without incident. She was constantly questioned about how her gender would fare in space and in a male dominated workplace. Sally Ride is now championed as a LGBTQ hero, when in fact she never revealed her sexuality when alive. In “The Trouble We’re In: Privilege, Power, and Difference,” it is mentioned that heterosexuals are never defined by their sexual preferences; however, in Ride’s case she was often labeled as not just a woman in space, but a LGBTQ woman in space. In addition to Ride, Rosalind Franklin’s discoveries were hidden and taken credit for by men, something that women suffer from, according to “The Trouble We’re In.” Benjamin Banneker had to write a twelve page essay to defend the intelligence of his race, because he wasn’t a privileged white. Science is, as evidenced by “The Trouble We’re In” and the stories of these scientists, highly controlled and influenced by privilege.</p>
       <p>If we were asked to draw a “scientist doing science” again, we agreed that our drawings wouldn’t necessarily change. They would still be drawn very general. Most of us would picture a chemist with beakers and the gender varying between person to person. This generalization of the STEAM community and its lack of diversity represents the very same problem we are discussing. Until we increase the social, economic, racial, and queer diversity in STEAM, we won’t be able to change this problematic stereotypical perspective.</p>

   <div class="Communication">
       <h1 style="text-align: center;">Communication</h1>
      <img src="images.jpg" style="width:20%" class="center">
       <p>Successful communicaters are able to use of multiple different styles of communication—such as writing, oral, and art—to convey a message. One part of communication is that sometimes the message of that piece is subtle and hard to figure out, and that does not mean that the creator is bad at communication but instead knows how to manipulate their work to enhance the overall presentation of their message. This year I learned and improved many different styles of communication through creating artwork and presentations as well as extensive writing. It is important to continue developing communication skills as communication is extremely important in college and almost every career. A succesful communicator will get jobs easier as they not only interview well, but can effectively communicate their ideas to their employers.</p>

       <p>My Personal Context Narrative (PCN) fits as communication because I had to create a story of multiple perspectives to communicate the central theme of not judging someone based on things they cannot change, such as their looks. This was the first essay I truly felt confident in my ability to write and communicate, and that reflected in the grade I got on the essay. My favorite part about this essay was being able to use different styles of writing, such as parentheses and dialogue. The essay made me excited for what's to come throughout the rest of Senior Inquiry.</p>

       <p>In this essay I had to pretend to be part of a Institutional Review Board (IRB) and review the experiment of Froedrick Frankenstein, who wanted to recreate Frankenstein's monster to study. This is another form of the unique communication styles that I experienced in Senior Inquiry. This time, I had to do it in the form of a letter addressed to Froedrick Frankenstein, explaining why the IRB board does not approve his experiment. This required a professional style of communication as well as an understanding of the IRB board's responsibilities.</p>

   <div class="Critical">
       <h1 style="text-align: center;">Critical Thinking</h1>
      <img src="images (1).jpg" style="width:20%" class="center">
       <p>Critical Thinking is the application of knowledge to solve problems and analyze text to communicate an idea. Solving problems is a common theme in the work force as many jobs, especially engineers and designers, have to use what they know to figure out what will work best for the company and the consumer. One of the most important parts of Senior Inquiry is learning how to use creative thinking to analyze different communication styles, specifically text.</p>

      <p>My Namesake research essay shows critical thinking because I had to use multiple pieces of work and tie them into the Namesake book to connect various stories from people in the real world to that of Gogol, the main character in Namesake. This essay could also connect with diversity as Gogol is an immigrant from India who experiences racial problems while living in the United States. It is important to be able to connect multiple diverse experiences to gain a better understanding of how people act.</p>

    <p>My spring research paper exemplifies critical thinking because I researched and connected multiple pieces about electric cars and used them to analyze the true impact electric cars have on the environment. I noticed that they are much worse for the environment that most people think, including myself before completing the paper. This paper could also fit under Ethics & Social Responsibility as it is discussing our responsibility to help the environment as we caused a majority of the current environmental issues. This paper as well as improving my critical thinking skills will greatly help my career as I need to write more papers in college and for my job and need to analyze statistics in computer science.</p>

       <h1 style="text-align: center;">Ethics & Social Responsibility</h1>
      <img src="images (2).jpg" style="width:20%" class="center">
       <p>Ethics and Social Responsibility is the use of personal morals to define what is right and wrong and using that to guide one's actions. It is important to look at ethics is multiple scenarios such as creating laws and dealing with issues as well as in everyday personal choices. This goal is useful in careers dealing like politics, law, and business that are responsible for their impact on people.</p>

      <p>My fall research paper applies for Ethics & Social Responsibility because it looks at the issue of health care for kids and if we should implement a system that provides health care for all kids at the expense of taxpayer's money. It looks at whether Americans should implement a system similar to the Canadian health care system where health care is deemed a right and given to every citizen. I argue that we are ethically responsible to provide health care to all kids.</p>

       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Ethics Panel</h2>
       <p style="text-align: center;">The ethics panel essay argues against the ethics of DNA testing and if it is ethical or unethical to promote commercial DNA testing. Our side argues the pro side, saying that it is ethical to use commercial DNA testing because it can help to find and treat current diseases and prevent future diseases that would cause suffering to those impacted.</p>

       <p style="text-align: center;">An Ethical Consideration of Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing</p>
       <p>Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing aims to provide individuals information about their genome for profit in return. It is currently used to test for thousands of diseases, but is not “a standard part of primary health care” (Berg, 2007, para. 2). To get tested, consumers use a saliva or swab kit to take a saliva sample which is then sent to the genetic testing company. Geneticists at the company track DNA sequences that correspond to each disease. By sending the saliva sample, consumers can learn if they have or are susceptible to certain diseases (Niemiec, 2017). Currently, there are seven main types of direct-to-consumer genetic testing ranging from diagnostic testing, which tests for diseases that are actively making a person ill, to predictive testing, which predicts the likelihood of someone developing certain diseases (Holtzman, 2018). Direct-to-consumer genetic testing has the potential to make the world a healthier, safer place. However, in order for the test to help as many people as possible, the confidentiality of each test must be ensured and genetic counseling must be provided to those unsure of what to do with the results of the test.</p>
       <p>The philosopher John Mill, who is well known for his theory of utilitarianism, would approve of direct-to-consumer genetic testing. A central goal of his argument is “an existence as far as possible from pain” (Mill, 1863, para. 14). Mills also views health as an “exemption from pain” (Mill, 1863, p. 36). Direct-to-consumer genetic testing is ethical from Mill’s viewpoint as it will act to minimize the pain in the world by making a healthier populace. While the effectiveness and accuracy of these tests are currently unreliable, as science moves forward and we learn more about genetics, the tests will become increasingly effective. According to an article by Niemiec, Kalokairinou, and Howard, all experts in bioethics, “not only has the number of companies grown in recent years, but their offer has expanded regarding the scope of the tests [and] technologies used” (2017). More companies and more tests are good news to consumers because more businesses creates competition. This drives supply up and price to consumer down, making tests more accessible to low income families. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing has the greatest impact on families that can not afford constant trips to the doctors office for screenings or tests. The affordability of the tests can and will save lives and reduce pain, making it fit nicely into Mill’s ethical theory. Competition will also drive technology forward, as each business strives to have the most accurate and most in-depth results. This continued innovation will be a benefit to all. Mills refers to health as “the greater good” (1863, para. 10), then while defining utilitarianism states as the greatest good for the greatest number. Direct-to-consumer testing promotes health, therefore promoting utilitarianism.</p>
       <p>One of the current issues with direct-to-consumer genetic tests is a lack of transparency from the businesses selling them. (Genet, 2007) In order to be ethical, they must properly explain the accuracy of their tests. They must also include a detailed explanation of what should be done with the results, including consulting any serious results with a medical professional before taking action. (Berg, 2007) The goal of these tests should be to increase the health of the consumer. In pursuance of that goal, lengths should be taken to ensure that results from direct-to-consumer tests are not used in ways that are detrimental to the health of the consumer. This also hits the ethical standard of beneficence. Goodwill towards participants is essential.</p>
       <p>Cheryl Berg, a lawyer who earned her J.D. from UC Berkeley in 1993, stated that the cost of getting tested ranges from $100 to $2000, which can be expensive for families in extreme poverty. She also noted that this cost is increasingly worse for inheritable diseases where multiple family members must be tested (2007). However, if consumers were to request the test from their physicians the test would be able to be covered by insurance (Berg, 2007). Furthermore, these tests could help prevent a diseases that would cause medical bills far more costly than the original genetic test.</p>
       <p>Including the financial burden that could be caused by the test, critics argue that the test could bring increased emotional distress for individuals and families. Testing positive for certain diseases could cause emotional pain such as “depression, grief, suicidal thoughts,” and survivor’s guilt, the guilty feeling that individuals in a family feel after testing negative for a disease impacting other members of the family (Berg, 2007, para. 16). While emotional distress can occur, it is insignificant compared to the despair and trauma that can occur with death, especially if that death could have been prevented by genetic testing.</p>
       <p>Direct-to-consumer genetic test results must, from an ethical standpoint, be kept private to ensure that businesses do not use the results for their personal benefit. If the results are given to private companies, such as insurance agencies, they could use the information to make biased decisions regarding the health status of the individual(s). Am Genet, Kathy Hudson, Gail Javitt, and other writers have experience in the medical field, and agree there are troubles with DTC testing. In 2006, the “Government Accountability Office issued a report documenting troubling marketing practices by some DTC testing companies...” (Genet, 2007, para. 2). These private companies must provide an adequate amount of information to their consumer on the label regarding accessibility and storage after the tests are finished. Private companies will use the personal information from the tests to their advantage, so in order to be ethical the confidentiality of the test must be clearly displayed.</p>
       <p>Moving forward, DTC test results must be confidential and get informed consent; it must give options for professional consultation in order to become ethical. As technology advances and tests become more reliable and accessible, direct-to-consumer genetic testing will become an ethical force of good. According to Mill’s theory of utilitarianism, it will minimize pain and preserve health.</p>
